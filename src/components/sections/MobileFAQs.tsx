      answer: "We provide comprehensive mobile testing reports including executive summaries, detailed bug reports with device-specific information, test coverage analysis, performance benchmarks, security assessment reports, app store readiness checklist, and recommendations for improvements. All documentation includes screenshots and video recordings from real devices."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer post-launch support and monitoring?",
