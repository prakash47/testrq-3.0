      question: "What should I expect in the technical interview?",
      answer:
        "The technical interview focuses on your QA knowledge, problem-solving approach, and relevant experience. We'll discuss testing methodologies, tools you've used, and how you handle different testing scenarios. It's more conversational than interrogational - we want to understand your thought process.",

      question: "Is the practical assessment mandatory for all roles?",
      answer:
        "Yes, all QA roles include a practical component, but it varies by position. Senior roles might involve system design or strategy discussions, while individual contributor roles focus on hands-on testing exercises. We provide clear instructions and reasonable timeframes for all assessments.",

        "What if I don't have experience with specific tools mentioned in the job posting?",

      question: "Do you provide feedback if I'm not selected?",

      question: "Can I reapply if I'm not selected this time?",
      answer:
        "Definitely! We encourage candidates to reapply after gaining additional experience or skills. We typically suggest waiting 6 months before reapplying for the same role, but you can apply for different positions anytime. Your previous application won't negatively impact future applications.",
    },
    {
      question: "What documents do I need to prepare?",
      answer:
        "You'll need an updated resume, cover letter (optional but recommended), and contact information for 2-3 professional references. For some roles, a portfolio of testing artifacts or automation scripts can be helpful. We'll let you know if anything specific is needed for your role.",
