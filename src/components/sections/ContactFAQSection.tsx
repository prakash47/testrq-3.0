      answer:
        "For urgent issues, we recommend calling our direct line at +1 (555) 012-3456 during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST). For critical production issues outside business hours, our emergency line is available 24/7. You can also use our live chat for immediate assistance during business hours.",

        "Response times vary by contact method: Email inquiries receive responses within 2 hours during business hours. Phone calls are answered immediately during business hours. Live chat provides instant responses. Scheduled meetings can typically be arranged within 24-48 hours.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer free consultations?",
      answer:
        "Yes! We offer free 15-minute consultations to discuss your QA needs and provide initial recommendations. For more detailed discussions, we also offer 45-minute deep dive sessions and 90-minute team workshops. You can schedule any of these through our Calendly integration.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I schedule a meeting outside of regular business hours?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! While our standard hours are Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST, we understand that different time zones and schedules require flexibility. When booking through Calendly, you can request alternative times, and we'll do our best to accommodate your schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "What information should I include when contacting you?",
      answer:
        "To help us provide the most relevant assistance, please include: your company name and industry, a brief description of your current testing challenges or needs, your project timeline and urgency level, and any specific technologies or platforms you're working with. The more details you provide, the better we can tailor our response.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide support for international clients?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is there a cost for initial consultations or quotes?",
      answer:
        "Initial consultations and project quotes are completely free. We believe in providing value upfront and helping you understand how we can assist your QA needs before any commitment. Detailed project scoping and custom solution development may involve fees, which we'll discuss transparently.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my message was received?",
      answer:
        "You'll receive an automatic confirmation email immediately after submitting our contact form. For phone calls, you'll speak directly with our team. For scheduled meetings, you'll receive calendar invitations and reminder emails. If you don't receive confirmation within a few minutes, please check your spam folder or contact us directly.",
